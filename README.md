# Ozone_depletion_detection_using_AI
The research has been implemented to classify the ground level-based ozone data based on complex machine learning models to solve this problem. The data has two classes as the target; here, the ozone day is represented by class one, and the non-ozone day is defined as class zero. Ground-level ozone is a hazardous pollutant that silently kills humans, animals, and plants.
